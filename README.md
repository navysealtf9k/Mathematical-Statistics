# Hello

I am Abdullah Farouk, a new master's student with the department of Statistics at UBC. I have an undergraduate degree in Economics and Finance from McGill University. If you would like to learn more about me [please click here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abdullah-farouk-a81a237a/)

### Goals in this course
In this course on High Dimensional Biology (Stat 540) I hope to learn about how bioinformaticians use statistical methods to support causal claims in their research. I hope this will provide me with a new way of thinking about research problems that are of interest to me.
